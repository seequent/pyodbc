# pyodbc

pyodbc is an open source Python module that makes accessing ODBC databases simple.  It
implements the [DB API 2.0](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249) specification but is
packed with even more Pythonic convenience.

The easiest way to install is to use pip:

    pip install pyodbc
    
Precompiled binary wheels are provided for most Python versions on Windows and macOS.  On other
operating systems this will build from source.

The rest of the pyodbc documentation is now on a Wiki so it can be maintained by the entire community.
